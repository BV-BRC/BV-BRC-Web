    This view affects only protein chains; Alpha helices are shown as "
    <font color='pink'>rockets</font>". Beta strands are shown as
    <font color="yellow">planks</font>. Arrowheads point towards the
    carboxy termini. The entire protein chain is shown as a smoothed
    backbone trace. Unstructured coils are
    <font color="white">white</font>. Make the background black with
    the Background button to make the backbone trace easier to see.
    Turns may (or may not) be colored
    <font color="blue">blue</font>.
