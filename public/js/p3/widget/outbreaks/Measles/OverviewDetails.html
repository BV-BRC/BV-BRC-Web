        individuals of all ages. The virus is known for its rapid spread through respiratory droplets and close contact,
        with outbreaks occurring primarily in areas with low vaccination coverage. Two does of the MMR vaccine has a <a

        In early 2025, a measles outbreak began in Texas, with cases quickly spreading to multiple states. Cases
        continue to increase and an up-to-date list of states, age distribution and hospital status can be found on the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html">CDC website</a>. The outbreak has
        been driven by low vaccination rates, with varying percentages of cases occurring in individuals who were either
        unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases, with a basic reproduction number (R0) ranging from 12 to
        18. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets and can linger in the air for up to two hours after an
        infected person leaves an area. Unvaccinated individuals, particularly young children, are at the highest risk
        of severe complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and death.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        The 2025 outbreak has predominantly affected children under five (34% of cases) and school-aged individuals
        (42%). Among hospitalized cases, young children remain the most vulnerable, with 27% of those under five
        requiring hospitalization.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Measles virus is an RNA virus with limited genetic variability compared to other viruses. However, genomic
        surveillance remains essential to track transmission chains and identify potential new variants.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Diagnostic confirmation is primarily achieved through PCR-based testing or serological analysis.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Since 1990 these 19 genotypes have been detected; A, B2, B3, C1, C2, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11,
        G2, G3, H1, H2. Vaccine strains are <a target="_blank"

    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        The resurgence of measles cases in 2025 underscores the ongoing challenge of vaccine hesitancy and declining
        immunization coverage. While the U.S. has maintained high overall vaccination rates, localized pockets of
        unvaccinated populations have facilitated the spread of the virus. The outbreak has also highlighted the need
        for enhanced public health measures, including catch-up vaccination campaigns, improved surveillance, and rapid
        response strategies.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Internationally, the measles outbreak has raised concerns about global vaccination gaps, with similar surges
        reported in parts of Europe and Africa. Public health agencies continue to emphasize the critical role of
        measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination in preventing future outbreaks.

        The measles virus genome consists of a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome of approximately 16 kb. It
        encodes eight proteins, including hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins that are critical for viral entry
        into host cells. Genetic sequencing is used to monitor viral evolution and potential shifts in transmission
        dynamics
