    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Monkeypox virus is the causative agent of Mpox, a viral zoonotic disease endemic to regions of Africa. Monkeypox
        virus (MPXV) is a member of the family Poxviridae, subfamily, Chordopoxvirinae, genus Orthopoxvirus, and species
        Orthopoxvirus monkeypox. Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is also a member of the Orthopoxvirus
        genus. Currently, two primary clades of MPXV are recognized, I and II, each with distinct genotypic and
        phenotypic properties. The two clades form distinct lineages on a phylogenetic tree, with evolving subclades
        present within each of the two primary clades. Clade I viruses have historically been responsible for outbreaks
        of Mpox in regions of Central Africa, primarily the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and are more pathogenic
        than clade II viruses with higher case fatality rates, ongoing transmission, and the emergence of new infection
        patterns in both human and animal populations. Clade II viruses have historically been responsible for outbreaks
        of milder disease in regions of Western Africa but have also been disseminated more widely, causing Mpox
        outbreaks in, for example, the United States in 2003 due to the importation of infected animals through the
        trade in exotic pets from Western Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
        From 1 January 2022 – 30 June 2024; over 99,176 confirmed Mpox cases and 208 deaths have been reported globally,
        spanning 117 countries. Although Clade II.b has been primarily responsible for this global outbreak, Clade I has
        remained a significant concern in Central Africa due to its severe impact. The DRC, a key region for Clade I,
        has witnessed a continuous rise in cases, with an outbreak that started in 2023 leading to a notable increase in
        the case-fatality rate. Mpox has remained endemic in regions of the DRC such as the province of Equateur, where
        young children under five are particularly vulnerable. The persistence of outbreaks across the DRC, including
        recent ones in Kamituga, South Kivu province, pose ongoing public health challenges. And the recent appearance
        of clade I-origin Mpox outside of Central Africa in Thailand and Sweden (see below), further increases the
        concern for the spread of clade I MPXV outside of its traditional geographic range.

            class="wrap">Emerging Concerns: Clade I Cases in Thailand and Sweden (2024)</span></h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        In 2024, two cases of Mpox Clade I have been reported outside of Africa, one in Thailand and another in Sweden.
        These cases are particularly concerning as Clade I is predominantly confined to Central Africa, where it is
        endemic. Detecting Clade I in these geographically distant regions raises questions about the virus's
        transmission pathways and the potential for broader international spread.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        The case in Thailand involved an individual with a recent travel history to Central Africa, suggesting direct
        exposure in an endemic region. However, the case in Sweden is more alarming as it was detected in an individual
        with no known travel history to Africa or direct contact with animals or persons from affected regions. This
        suggests the possibility of undetected transmission chains or other complex epidemiological factors.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px">
        Both cases have prompted heightened surveillance and investigation by health authorities. The emergence of Clade
        1 outside of its traditional endemic region underscores the need for global vigilance, rapid diagnostic
        capabilities, and coordinated international response strategies to prevent further spread of this more virulent
        strain.
    </p>

<div class="section far2x" id="epidemiology-transmission-section">
    <h3 class="close2x section-title"><span class="wrap">Epidemiology and Transmission</span></h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        MPOX is transmitted through direct contact with infected wild animals, through close contact (including intimate
        or sexual contact) with a person with mpox, and through contact with contaminated materials. MPOX Clade I is
        more transmissible. Before 2024 there was no sexual transmission of MPOX caused by Clade I. However, recent
        reports indicate transmission among sex workers and mining workers in the region, a pattern previously observed
        with both smallpox and Mpox Clade II.b. The disease's epidemiology in Central Africa differs significantly from
        other parts of the world, with the DRC's mpox case fatality ratio being notably higher. In Africa, the fatality
        ratio is much higher than in other regions, with 3% of the global confirmed cases occurring in the continent but
        accounting for 12% of the global deaths. This disparity highlights the critical need for tailored public health
        interventions.

<div class="section far2x" id="characteristics-diagnostic-section">
    <h3 class="close2x section-title"><span class="wrap">Genetic Characteristics and Diagnostic Challenges</span></h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Clade I of the monkeypox virus, primarily detected through sequencing in Central Africa, shows mutations
        suggestive of APOBEC activity, a key factor in the virus's ongoing evolution. The global mutation shift from
        Clade II.a to Clade I and then to Clade II.b underscores the complexity of tracking and responding to the
        virus's spread. Diagnostic challenges persist, with only 10% of reported cases in the DRC in 2024 being
        laboratory-confirmed. Co-infection with HIV and syphilis further complicates the epidemiological landscape,
        making accurate diagnostics and effective treatment strategies critical.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section far2x" id="implications-section">
    <h3 class="close2x section-title"><span class="wrap">Regional and Global Implications</span></h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        In 2024, four new countries in Eastern Africa—Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda—reported their first mpox
        cases, all linked to the expanding outbreak in East and Central Africa. Sequencing efforts confirmed that these
        cases are associated with Clade I. As the outbreak continues to shift across health zones in the DRC,
        particularly in Equateur and Kamituga, the need for updated WHO laboratory guidance and effective therapeutic
        strategies becomes increasingly urgent. Early evidence suggests that combination therapies may be required, and
        ongoing studies are necessary to evaluate vaccine effectiveness.

        <b>Orthopoxvirus</b> is a genus of double-stranded DNA viruses within the Poxviridae family that infect mammals,
        including humans, where they cause skin lesions. Notably, the Variola virus, responsible for smallpox, was
        eradicated through vaccination.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        <b>Virion Structure:</b> Orthopoxvirus virions are enveloped, brick-shaped particles measuring 250nm in length
        and
        200nm in width. The surface features tubules or filaments. There are two forms of infectious particles: the
        intracellular mature virus (IMV) and the extracellular enveloped virus (EEV).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        <b>Genome:</b> The virus has a linear, double-stranded DNA genome ranging from 170-250kb, flanked by inverted
        terminal
        repeat (ITR) sequences that form covalently closed hairpin termini.
