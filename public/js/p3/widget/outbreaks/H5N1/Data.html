                An FTP (File Transfer Protocol) site allows users to download files over the internet. To access the
                data, users must connect to the BV-BRC FTP site and download the relevant files to their local systems.
                Tutorials for setting up FTP are available <a
                    href="https://www.bv-brc.org/docs/quick_references/ftp.html" target="_blank">here</a>. A mapping
                text file is provided to help users understand which sequences are included, corresponding to the FASTA
                files, MSA, and tree files.

                For sequences prior to 2024, H5N1 DNA sequences for segments were downloaded from BV-BRC only from
                isolates for which all 8 segments were present in the database. This was followed by quality control
                (QC) and representative sequence selection:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <li>For Segment 4, a minimum length cutoff of 1600nt was used, allowing no more than 0.1% undetermined
                    residues (“N”).
                </li>
                <li>Representative sequence selection was performed by clustering using cd-hit with a cutoff of 0.98%.
                </li>
                <li>Other segments were retained only for those isolates for which Segment 4 passed the QC and
                    clustering step.
                </li>
                <li>Sequences prior to 2003 were excluded from the analysis to prevent the resulting trees from being
                    overly long.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                For 2024
                sequences, all H5N1 sequences from BV-BRC were used without additional quality control or clustering.
                While all sequences undergo quality control, users are encouraged to review alignments manually before
                submitting them to programs specific to ancestral alignment to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
