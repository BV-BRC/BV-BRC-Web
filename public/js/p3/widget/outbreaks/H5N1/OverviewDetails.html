        Influenza A virus subtype H5N1, commonly known as avian influenza virus (AIV) or bird flu, has garnered
        significant attention due to its potential to cause severe illness in both birds and humans. Originating
        primarily in wild birds, H5N1 can infect domestic poultry, posing significant economic and public health
        concerns. H5N1 infections are rare in humans but have been associated with high mortality rates, making it a
        focus of pandemic preparedness efforts. Continuous surveillance and research are crucial for monitoring H5N1
        activity, understanding its transmission dynamics, and developing effective control measures to mitigate the
        risk of widespread outbreaks.

                Isolated outbreaks of H5N1 AIV have been documented since 1996-1997. These outbreaks have revealed
                ongoing evolution of the H5N1 subtype, in association with an increasingly diverse host range. The
                current outbreak was first documented in 2020, and spread mainly through migrating birds across Africa,
                Asia, and Europe, causing significant wild bird deaths and poultry outbreaks. These viruses reached
                North America by late 2021 and South America in 2022. In late 2022, viruses from this lineage caused an
                outbreak in a mink farm in Spain, an example of evolving mammalian adaption.

                Human infections of AIV H5N1 viruses are tracked by CDC and WHO. Globally, 26 human cases have been
                documented from Jan 2022-April 2024. More information about these human cases can be seen in a <a

                    target="_blank">technical report</a> from the CDC. The cases involve H5N1 “clades” (subspecies)
                2.3.2.1c and 2.3.4.4b. Most human cases had contact with dead or sick poultry. There has been no
                reported human-to-human transmission from this period. Since 2020, six human cases of A(H5N1) linked to
                the 2.3.4.4b clade have been reported to WHO.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                In late March 2024, a dairy farm worker experienced redness and discomfort in the right eye. Upon
                examination, subconjunctival hemorrhage and serious drainage were observed. The worker had close contact
                with dairy cows, some exhibiting signs of illness consistent with A(H5N1) virus infection. Testing of
                the farm worker revealed influenza A(H5) clade 2.3.4.4b virus in conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab
                specimens. The worker was isolated at home and treated with oseltamivir; the symptoms resolved The virus
                showed genetic similarity to strains found in Texas dairy cattle and wild birds. Although it maintained
                avian characteristics, it had a mutation associated with adaptation to mammalian hosts. No genetic
                markers for antiviral drug resistance were found. The virus's hemagglutinin closely resembled existing
                candidate vaccine viruses for A(H5N1).

        Further testing confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection. The virus showed genetic similarity to strains

    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Influenza A virus, a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is a significant etiological agent of influenza, an
        acute respiratory illness with substantial global impact. Characterized by its enveloped structure housing a
        segmented, negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, this virus exhibits remarkable genetic plasticity,
        facilitating rapid evolutionary adaptation and strain diversification.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Preventative strategies against influenza A entail vaccination campaigns targeting prevalent strains alongside
        infection control measures emphasizing respiratory hygiene and social distancing. Therapeutic interventions,
        predominantly relying on neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes, aim to facilitate symptomatology and mitigate
        disease progression, particularly when administered promptly following symptom onset.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Influenza A is organized into distinct evolutionary lineages, “clades”, characterized by genetic divergence and
        phylogenetic clustering. These clades arise from the continuous genetic reassortment and mutation inherent to
        the virus, leading to novel strains with unique antigenic profiles. Scientists classify influenza A viruses into
        clades to track their evolutionary trajectories, assess antigenic variation, and select vaccine strains.
        Understanding the dynamics of influenza A clades is paramount for predicting seasonal epidemics, anticipating
        pandemics, and developing targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of this ever-evolving viral pathogen on
        global public health.

        Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on their surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and
        neuraminidase (N) - for example, H5N1, H3N2, etc.

    <h3 class="close2x section-title"><span class="wrap">Disease Information</span></h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        In humans, the influenza A virus spreads efficiently via respiratory droplets, efficiently exploiting host
        respiratory epithelial cells as its primary replication site. The virus's capacity for antigenic drift and shift
        is critical to its pathogenic prowess, which evades host immune surveillance, precipitating periodic epidemics
        and potential pandemics.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Clinical manifestations of influenza A infection encompass a spectrum of symptoms, including fever, malaise,
        myalgia, respiratory distress, and complications such as pneumonia. The severity of the disease often correlates
        with host factors, including age, immune status, and underlying health conditions.

<div class="section close2x" id="epidemiology-section">
    <h3 class="close2x section-title"><span class="wrap">Epidemiology</span></h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Influenza is a well-studied virus, and much previous work has been done to understand and monitor mutations that
        may affect virus transmissibility, virulence, and antigenic properties, which could impact vaccine efficacy.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Influenza A viruses are of particular concern due to their ability to infect many hosts, including humans,
        birds, pigs, and other mammals. The transmission dynamics of influenza A viruses between animals and humans vary
        depending on the specific virus subtype and the characteristics of the host species involved.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Avian influenza A viruses, such as HPAI A(H5N1), primarily circulate among birds, particularly wild aquatic
        birds, which serve as natural reservoirs. Transmission to humans typically occurs through direct or close
        contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets or farms. Human infections
        with avian influenza viruses often result from exposure to respiratory secretions or feces of infected birds.
        While human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses is possible, it usually occurs sporadically and is
        limited in scope.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        In contrast, swine influenza A viruses, such as H1N1 and H3N2, can infect pigs and humans. Transmission of swine
        influenza viruses from pigs to humans can occur through direct contact with infected pigs, inhalation of
        virus-containing aerosols, or contact with contaminated surfaces. Certain occupational groups, such as pig
        farmers and veterinarians, are at higher risk of swine influenza virus exposure.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Influenza A viruses' potential to undergo genetic reassortment in intermediate hosts, such as pigs, poses a risk
        for the emergence of novel virus strains with pandemic potential. Reassortment occurs when two different
        influenza viruses infect the same host cell and exchange genetic material, generating a new virus with a
        combination of genes from both parent viruses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Effective surveillance and control measures, including monitoring animal populations, early detection of novel
        virus strains, and implementation of biosecurity measures, are crucial for mitigating the risk of zoonotic
        transmission of influenza A viruses and reducing the likelihood of pandemic emergence. Additionally, research
        into the genetic and ecological factors influencing virus transmission between animals and humans is essential
        for improving our understanding of influenza epidemiology and informing public health interventions.
