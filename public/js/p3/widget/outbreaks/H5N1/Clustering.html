                H5N1 Clustering
            </h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                For sequences prior to 2024 we downloaded H5N1 DNA sequences for segments from BV-BRC only from isolates
                for which all 8 segments were present in the database. This was followed by QC and representative
                sequence selection: For Segment 4 we used a minimal length cutoff of 1600nt and allowed no more than
                0.1% undetermined residues (“N”). Representative sequence selection was accomplished by clustering using
                cd-hit with a cutoff of 98% identity. Other segments were then only retained for those from isolates for
                which segment 4 passed the QC and clustering step.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                In order to prevent the resulting trees from being overly long, we did not include sequences prior to
                2003 in the analysis.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                For 2024 sequences we used all H5N1 sequences from BV-BRC. From these sequences, only sequences from
                strains which contained all eight segments were retained.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                2024 and older segments sequences were then concatenated per isolate and in order und clustered using
                cd-hit with a cutoff of 99% identity. Individual segment sequences from the same isolates as the
                clustering result when then used for phylogenetic inference. Human hosted isolates were re-introduced if
                removed by clustering.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT v7.520 with most accurate options (--maxiterate
                1000 --localpair). Trees were then inferred by RAxML-NG v1.2.0 using GTR model and four gamma
                distributed rates with 100 non-parametric bootstraps.

                was used for the cleaning up of meta data (example, “duck”, “mallard duck”, and “Anas platyrhynchos”
                transformed to “Duck”) and to decorate the inferred trees with meta-data, resulting in richly annotated
                phyloXML-formatted (Han and Zmasek, 2009) trees.
