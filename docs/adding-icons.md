# How to Add/Update SVG Icons

Below we describe the process of adding SVG icons to the codebase, making icons readily available for use in the UI.

1) Go to [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io/), or similar
2) Find the icon you want to add, and then download it as SVG into `/public/icon_source/`
3) At [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io/), import all the icons from `/public/icon_source/` into a set.
4) Select all icons in that set, and then generate the font.
5) Download that font (which will come as a zip), and expand it into `/public/js/p3/resources/icomoon/` overwriting the content that is already there.
6) Commit!
